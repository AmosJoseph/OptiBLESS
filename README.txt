Overview
---------
The Stacking Sequence Optimisation and Retrieval Toolbox (SSORT) is a simple MATLAB tool-box allowing you to optimise composite laminate stacking sequences.
SSORT can either be used to directly optimise stacking sequence for a given problem or to retrieve stacking sequence matching intermediate parameters such
as lamination parameters or stiffness matrices. The code is easily accesible to everybody who posseses a basic understanding 
in classical laminate theory and optimisation. 

Detailed explanation about how to use the code are provided in the PDF file distributed with the code. Decription about the 
working of the code itself are not available at the moment (possibly will be in the future).


Requirement
-----------
- MATLAB 2014.b or more recent
- MATLAB Optimisation toolbox (GA and fmincon)
