--- Done
a) Remove the -90 degree by starting initial angles at 1 (done)


---- At present

a) Clean the code for 1 geometrical continuity (unique guide)
b) Work on the selling points (what? more appealing examples -- aircraft wing? capabilities most needed)
c) SSORT Conference paper
d) ADD A CONSTRAINTS THAT CHECKS THE NUMBER OF LOCAL DROPS PLIES BETWEEN PATCHES AND CHECK IF THE INTERMEDIARY STEP CAN BE NEGLECTED.



----- Possible future development (functionalities)
a) Direct implementation of the 10% rule
b) Geometrical continuity (multi-guide possibilities with patch interface)
c) structure with more than one blending methodology or material ??
