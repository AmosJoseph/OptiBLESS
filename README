Overview
---------
The Stacking Sequence Retriever (SSR) is a simple MATLAB tool-box allowing you to retrieve composite laminate stacking sequences from
stiffness matrices or lamination parameters. The code is easily accesible to everybody who posseses a basic understanding 
in classical laminate theory and optimisation. 

Detailed explanation about how to use the code are provided in the PDF file distributed with the code. Decription about the 
working of the code itself are not available at the moment (possibly will be in the future).


Requirement
-----------
- MATLAB 2012 or more recent
- MATLAB Optimisation toolbox (GA and fmincon)
