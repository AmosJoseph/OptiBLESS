---- At present
0) create option for explicit or implicit 10% rule
0) reduce check feasibility for symmetric tables
0) Create Stacking Sequence that do not follow all design guildeins but remove access to the corresponding NPLY (may result in new design?)
0) Inipop Generation for N insert variable (>12) become difficult

0) Explicit disorientation (1 theta and the rest delta theta's)
0) Better inipop (closer to Nminply) : Faster generation
0) find a better value for the number of drop variable
0) create dedicated GA operators (in particular, subfield operators like crossover)


b) Work on the selling points (what? more appealing examples -- aircraft wing? capabilities most needed)
c) SSORT Conference paper
d) ADD A CONSTRAINTS THAT CHECKS THE NUMBER OF LOCAL DROPS PLIES BETWEEN PATCHES AND CHECK IF THE INTERMEDIARY STEP CAN BE NEGLECTED.



----- Possible future development (functionalities)
a) Geometrical continuity (multi-guide possibilities with patch interface)
b) structure with more than one blending methodology or material ??
