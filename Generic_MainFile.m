%% === Objective
% The default fitness function pre-coded in SSORT require the objective structure. 
% The objective structure mostly contains data about fitness calculation.
% There are 3 different objective structures depending on the type of
% fitness functions that you will be using. 
%  It can either be a fitness function based on:
%           - Lamination parameters ('LP')
%           - Stiffness Matrices ('ABD')
%       or  - Stacking Sequences ('SS') 


% =================== Objectives.Table for Lamination Parameters (LP)

% Laminate #           : Laminate ID defining a particular patch (should be unique for each row) 
% Nplies [LB, UB]      : Lower and Upper number of plies allowed for this patch 
% LP2Match             : Lamination parameters that are desired for this patch
% Scaling Coefficients : Coefficient use to quantify the relative matching importance 
%                        of each lamination parameter (if no preference, use a vector of ones)

Objectives.Table   = [{'Laminate #'}      {'Nplies [LB,UB]'}        {'LP2Match'}         {'Scaling Coefficients'} ;

% A2Match   : In-plane stiffness matrice parameters that are desired for this patch                         
% A Scaling : Coefficient use to quantify the relative importance of each of the in-plane
%             stiffness matrice parameters that are desired for this patch

% {DiscreteAngle}.      Discrete fibre angles are used (possible values are set with Constraints.DeltaAngle (below)

% {Covering}.           Covering plies on the lower and upper surfaces of the laminate cannot be dropped.
